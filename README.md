# Neovim configuration

This is my neovim configuration based on features and modularity. The main goal
is a configuration that just works in any environment that neovim supports while
still being easy to modify and manage.

## Philosophy

- Neovim just works at a minimum level with the absense of plugins, external
  applications or terminal capabilities.
- Any feature is only available when the necessary requirements are met.
- Features work the same regarless of the platform.
- The user decides which features to enable.
- The user is responsible for dependencies.
- Neovim helps manage features and dependencies with
  [`:Commands`][nvim.commands.help] and configuration files.
- Neovim needs to ask the user before automatic access of resources outside the
  [standard paths][nvim.standardpaths.help]. Including network access.
